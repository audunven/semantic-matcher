Installation instructions for WordNet 1.7.1 Unix database package.

1. Manifest

When the WordNet database package is unbundled you should have the
following files and subdirectories in this directory:

	CHANGES		changes to WordNet since version 1.6
	INSTALL		this file
	LICENSE		WordNet copyright and license agreement
	Makefile	Makefile for WordNet database package
	README		README file for WordNet system
	README.doc	Information on WordNet documentation
	README.list	Information about WordNet users mailing list
	README.tcktk	Information about using Tcl/Tk with WordNet
	UNBUNDLE	instructions for unbundling WordNet packages
	bin		precompiled binaries for some Unix platforms
	dict		WordNet database files
	doc		WordNet Reference Manual - HTML, PDF, and PostScript
	include		WordNet source code header files
	lib		precompiled WordNet library for some Unix platforms
	logs	logs of 1.7.1 build on different platforms
	man		WordNet Reference Manual - "man" pages
	src		source code for WordNet library and interfaces

2. Makefile 

To prepare WordNet for installation on your system you must edit the
Makefile.  Following is a brief description of the variables used for
a binary installation.  See the Makefile for more information about
each variable, and additional variables that must be set to compile
the WordNet source code.

	PLATFORM	Computer platform for binary installation.
			The default is "solaris".

	WN_ROOT		Root of WordNet installation directory hierarchy.
			The default is /usr/local/WordNet-1.7.1

	WN_BINDIR	Directory for installation of binaries.
			Default is $WN_ROOT/bin.

	WN_DICTDIR	Directory for installation of WordNet database.
			Default is $WN_ROOT/dict

	INSTALLCMD	Command to use to install database files.
			Default is "cp".  Setting this to "mv" moves
			the database into the $WN_DICTDIR directory
			instead of copying it.  This saves disk space
			by keeping only one copy of the database around.

	INSTALLFLAGS	Defaults to "-p" for use with "INSTALLCMD=cp".
			Set to "" if using "INSTALLCMD=mv".
		
	WN_LIBDIR	Directory for installation of WordNet library
			libwn.a.  Defaults to $WN_ROOT/lib

	WN_INCDIR	Directory for installation of WordNet header
			files.  Defaults to $WN_ROOT/include.

	WN_MANDIR	Directory for installation of WordNet man pages.
			Default is $WN_ROOT/man.

	WN_DOCDIR	Directory for installation of WordNet man pages
			in HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.  Default 
			is $WN_ROOT/doc.

3. Binary Installation

To install the WordNet database, precompiled browsers, library, header
files and documentation, first edit the Makefile as indicated above.
Then type:

	make BinWorld

4. Compiling the WordNet Source Code

This version of the WordNet window-based browser is written in Tcl/Tk.
If you want to compile the browser on your system, you must have the
Tcl/TK 8 libraries installed on your system.  Read the file
README.tcltk for information about Tcl/Tk.

To compile the WordNet source code, first read the instructions in the
Makefile and edit it accordingly.  The type:

	make SrcWorld

Due to the many different computer platforms and specifics of each
Unix site, it may take some trial and error to get the source code to
compile and link on your platform.  WordNet is provided precompiled
for all the platforms that we at Princeton have access to.  If you are
having trouble compiling WordNet on some other platform, you should
speak to your local system administrator and NOT send mail to the
Cognitive Science Laboratory.  We do not have the staff or resources
to support this activity.

5. Using WordNet

5.1 Environment Variables

The WordNet database can be accessed with a command line interface,
'wn', or a window-based browser, 'wnb'.  Both are installed in the
$WN_BINDIR directory indicated in the Makefile.  $WN_BINDIR must be in
your PATH environment variables in order for the commands to be found.

The browsers have several ways of finding the WordNet database files.
If neither the WNHOME nor WNSEARCHDIR environment variables are set,
it expects to find the database files in /usr/local/WordNet-1.7.1/dict.
If WNSEARCHDIR is set, it looks in that directory.  If WNHOME is set,
the search code looks in WNHOME/dict.  

If you install all of WordNet in a directory tree other than
/usr/local/WordNet-1.7.1, it is best to set WNHOME to that location and
not set WNSEARCHDIR.  If you install the database files in a location
outside of both the default and WNHOME hierarchies (perhaps because
there isn't enough disk space to put everything together), you should
set WNSEARCHDIR to the directory in which the database is installed,
and WNHOME to the root directory for the rest of the package.

The browser 'wnb' uses several resource files.  It expects to find
them in /usr/local/WordNet-1.7.1/lib/wnres.  If WNHOME is set, it looks
in WNHOME/lib/wnres.

If you install the manual pages in a directory that is not already in
your MANPATH, you must add that directory to MANPATH in order for the
'man' command to find the WordNet manual pages.

5.2 Running the WordNet Interfaces

The command 'wn' runs the command line interface.  This is usually
used from other applications or shell scripts, or by users who do not
have access to a graphical windowing system (ie. using "telnet"). See
the manual page 'wn' for details.

The command 'wnb' runs the graphical interface.  See the manual page
'wnb' for details.

6. Cleaning Up

6.1 Removing the Extra Copy of the Database Files

If you do not set INSTALLCMD to "mv", when WordNet is installed the
database files are copied to $WN_DICTDIR.  To save disk space, after
installation (and testing to make sure all is well), you can remove the
database files from the download directory with the command:

	make cleandbfiles

6.2 Uninstalling WordNet

You can remove the various pieces of WordNet from the installation
directories with the command:
	
	make uninstall

Note that this does not attempt to remove directories, and does not
remove the database files.  You must remove the database files "by
hand".  This is done as a precaution, since downloading the database
again, should it be inadvertently removed, is a real pain.

6.3 Saving Disk Space

If disk space is at a premium, and you are not doing research or
development using WordNet, you can remove the file "index.sense" from
the database installation directory.  This file is quite large, and is
not used by the WordNet browsers.
